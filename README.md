# Scala.js interface to Cesium.js

[Cesium](http://cesiumjs.org/) is a JavaScript library for creating 3D globes and 2D maps in a web browser without a plugin. 
It uses WebGL for hardware-accelerated graphics, and is cross-platform, cross-browser, 
and tuned for dynamic-data visualization. 

This library **cesiumscala**, is a Scala.js fa√ßade to Cesium.js.
Cesium client applications can now be written in [Scala](http://www.scala-lang.org/) and compiled into javascript
using [Scala.js](https://www.scala-js.org/).

## Installation

To compile and generate a jar file from the source:

    sbt package

The jar file (cesiumscala_sjs0.6_2.11-1.0.jar) will be in the "./target/scala-2.11" directory.

## Dependencies code inclusions

The code from [jsext](https://github.com/jducoeur/jsext) relating to JSOptionBuilder is used in **cesiumscala** and
is included here rather than as an external dependency.

**cesiumscala** depends on [scala-js-dom](https://github.com/scala-js/scala-js-dom), see also build.sbt.

## Usage

Add the following dependency to your build.sbt:

    libraryDependencies += "com.github.workingDog" %%% "cesiumscala" % "1.0"

**cesiumscala** makes extensive use of [jsext](https://github.com/jducoeur/jsext) JSOptionBuilder for
defining "options" objects. Here these objects are named "class-name + Options". For example:

    class ModelGraphics(options: ModelGraphicsOptions)

Example of ModelGraphicsOptions:

    new ModelGraphics(
            ModelGraphicsOptions.uri(new ConstantProperty(url)).
            minimumPixelSize(new ConstantProperty(128)).maximumScale(new ConstantProperty(20000)))

See also the [Using the JSOptionBuilder](https://github.com/jducoeur/jsext#using-the-jsoptionbuilder) documentation.
